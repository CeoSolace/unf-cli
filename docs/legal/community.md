# Community Guidelines

UnfilteredUK is a diverse network of communities. To foster healthy discussion and collaboration, we expect all members to adhere to these guidelines:

1. **Be Respectful** – Treat others with respect. Disagreements are fine but personal attacks are not.
2. **Keep It Legal** – Do not share or request illegal content. This includes pirated material and explicit content involving minors.
3. **Protect Privacy** – Do not share private information about yourself or others. Use caution when clicking links shared by other users.
4. **Stay On Topic** – Keep discussions relevant to the channel topic. Use appropriate channels for off‑topic conversations.
5. **Report Issues** – Use the reporting tools if you encounter harassment, spam or other issues. Do not attempt to handle it yourself.

We reserve the right to remove content or restrict access for violations of these guidelines. Our goal is to create a welcoming space for everyone.

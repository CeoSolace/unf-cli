# Moderation Policy

UnfilteredUK provides tools and policies to help communities remain safe, inclusive and compliant with our Terms of Service. Moderation is performed by community owners, designated moderators and in some cases automated systems.

## Community Guidelines

Communities hosted on UnfilteredUK must enforce the following rules:

- No harassment, hate speech or bullying.
- No incitement of violence or illegal activity.
- No sharing of personal data without consent.
- Respect intellectual property rights.

## Reporting Content

Users can report content they believe violates our Terms of Service. Reports are encrypted and include only metadata such as message ID, server ID and reporter ID. The content itself remains encrypted.

Reports are reviewed by moderators. Repeated offenders may be warned, temporarily suspended or permanently banned at the discretion of moderators or administrators.

## Appeals

If you believe your account was moderated in error you may appeal by contacting support. Decisions by `admin_root` are final.
